Write a simple implementation of the Connect Four game that works in a web browser.

When a user opens the page in their browser, it should display a game board and indicate which player (e.g. red player) takes the turn. Players take turns using a single browser window (no server-side code needed). When one of the players wins, the page should indicate the winner, the game ends and no more moves can be made.

Things to keep in mind:

Keep the code light. You can use basic JavaScript libraries (jQuery/Zepto) though.
You don't need to spend too much time on the UI. It's enough if it's playable, doesn't have to be pretty.
Try to write the code in such a way that it's modular and easily testeable (you can do a bit of TDD too), e.g. try to separate the game board logic from the UI.
It should be playable on modern mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari).
Start simple and leave improvements for later. You should be able to have something working in 2-3 hours.
